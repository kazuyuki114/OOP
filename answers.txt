Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title 
then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
- Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods 
with different parameter lists, 
as long as they have unique signatures.
