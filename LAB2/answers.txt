Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title 
then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
- No, when we perform this action, Java will display a notification indicating that the method (constructor) 
has been duplicated, which means that Java has marked it as an error 
(java: constructor DVD(java.lang.String) is already defined in class DVD) and will prevent the run of program later.
