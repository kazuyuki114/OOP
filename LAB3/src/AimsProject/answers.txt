- Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
- Write constructors for parent and child classes. Remove redundant setter methods if any

When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class,
you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes
as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the
passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

Answer: If the passed object is not an instance of Media, the equals() method returns false.
This indicates that the two objects are not equal,
as they belong to different classes or incompatible types.
It will result in a ClassCastException at runtime. This can potentially crash your program.
